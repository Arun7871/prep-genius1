    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Research the Company</h2>
            <p>Before the interview, thoroughly research the company, its culture, values, and the role you're applying
                for. This knowledge will help you tailor your responses and demonstrate your genuine interest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Prepare Your Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>Have a concise and compelling elevator pitch ready. It should briefly describe your background, skills,
                and what you can bring to the company.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Dress Appropriately</h2>
            <p>Dress professionally and in accordance with the company's dress code. When in doubt, it's better to be
                slightly overdressed than underdressed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Practice Common Interview Questions</h2>
            <p>Be ready to answer common interview questions such as "Tell me about yourself," "What are your strengths
                and weaknesses," and "Why should we hire you?" Practice your responses to these questions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Use the STAR Method</h2>
            <p>When answering behavioral questions (e.g., "Tell me about a time when..."), structure your responses
                using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to provide a well-organized and detailed answer.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Highlight Achievements</h2>
            <p>Use specific examples of your accomplishments to demonstrate your skills and abilities. Use quantifiable
                results whenever possible to showcase your impact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. Ask Questions</h2>
            <p>Prepare thoughtful questions to ask the interviewer. This shows your interest in the role and company.
                Questions about the company's future plans, team dynamics, and expectations for the role are good
                options.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. Body Language</h2>
            <p>Maintain good eye contact, offer a firm handshake, and sit up straight. Your body language should convey
                confidence and professionalism.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>9. Active Listening</h2>
            <p>Listen carefully to the interviewer's questions and respond directly. Avoid interrupting and wait for the
                interviewer to finish speaking before answering.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>10. Adaptability</h2>
            <p>Be prepared for different interview formats, such as panel interviews, one-on-one interviews, or video
                interviews. Adapt to the format and maintain your composure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>11. Handle Behavioral Questions</h2>
            <p>Be ready to discuss how you've handled challenges, conflicts, and difficult situations in the workplace.
                Use these examples to showcase your problem-solving and interpersonal skills.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>12. Stay Calm Under Pressure</h2>
            <p>If you encounter a difficult or unexpected question, take a moment to gather your thoughts before
                responding. It's okay to pause and think.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>13. Show Enthusiasm</h2>
            <p>Display your enthusiasm for the role and the company. Employers value candidates who are genuinely
                excited about the opportunity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>14. Follow Up</h2>
            <p>After the interview, send a personalized thank-you email to express your appreciation and reiterate your
                interest in the position.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>15. Practice, Practice, Practice</h2>
            <p>Conduct mock interviews with a friend or career coach to get comfortable with the interview process. This
                can help reduce anxiety and improve your performance.</p>
